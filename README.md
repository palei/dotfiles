# My dotfiles

Configs and other scripts that I need on all my Linux-based systems.

## Install

Clone this repo:

    git clone git@github.com:palei/dotfiles.git

Install requirements:

    pip install requirements.txt

Install the files like so:

   cd dotfiles
   ./install

The installation script creates a symlink for everything defined in the `settings.yaml` file.
