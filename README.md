## My configs

This is where I keep my common config files so they can be easily updated and installed on new systems.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a personal project, but it may be useful for other too.

## How to use

1. Put, replace or edit configs in the `configs` folder.
2. Set correct paths in `settings.yaml`.
3. Use `./install.py` to put config files in place.
